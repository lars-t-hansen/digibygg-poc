This program is derived from the AWS embedded C IOT SDK,
https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-embedded-C, version 202108.00.  It is a variant of the
demos/mqtt/mqtt_demo_mutual_auth demo program.

See Makefile for information about how to build.

To run, the libraries built by the build process must be in a suitable path, I usually do

   LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/p/aws-iot-device-sdk-embedded-C/build/lib ./snappysense
